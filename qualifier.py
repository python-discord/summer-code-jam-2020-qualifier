Use this file to write your solution for the Summer Code Jam 2020 Qualifier.

Important notes for submission:

- Do not change the names of the two classes included below. The test suite we
  will use to test your submission relies on existence these two classes.

- You can leave the `ArticleField` class as-is if you do not wish to tackle the
  advanced requirements.

- Do not include "debug"-code in your submission. This means that you should
  remove all debug prints and other debug statements before you submit your
  solution.
